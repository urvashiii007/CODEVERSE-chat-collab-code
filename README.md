🚀 CodeVerse — Real-Time Collaborative Coding Platform

CodeVerse is a Google-Docs-style live collaborative IDE that allows multiple developers to code, chat, test, and plan together inside a single shared workspace — without any setup or configuration.

Built for hackathons, students, remote teams, and pair-programming, CodeVerse removes collaboration friction and makes teamwork smooth and productive.

🔥 Key Features

Real-time collaborative code editing (sub-second sync)

Multi-file explorer with folder structure

Built-in group chat and online/offline presence

Collaborative drawing board for logic, UI & architecture

Run code inside the platform without external compilers

Custom themes and font settings

Download complete project as a ZIP

Planned Copilot-style AI Assistant for code generation & debugging

🧠 Why CodeVerse Is Unique

Unlike traditional collaborative editors that only sync text, CodeVerse integrates coding + planning + communication + execution + AI assistance into one screen.
Teams can write code, discuss ideas, sketch logic, and run programs — all in the same room without switching tools.

📌 Problem Statement

Remote teams lack a smooth and true real-time coding experience. Existing tools require complex setup and lack multi-file collaboration, integrated chat, planning tools, and in-platform execution.
CodeVerse solves this by creating a complete remote development environment inside the browser.

Removes environment setup barriers

Boosts productivity for remote developers, students & hackathon teams

Improves learning and brainstorming experience

Makes group debugging and architecture planning faster
